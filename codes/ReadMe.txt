The software contains a database of its to run effectively named as "sqlgenerator.db" , containing several tables including -
1.	TName(tname,dbname,query)
2.	VName(vname,dbname)
3.	mainlogin(NAME,PASSWORD)
4.	DTBS(UN,DBN)

The "sqlgenerator.db" is essential in order to execute or run the software so it cannot be deleted. All the other databases seen are the user created databases
that can be deleted or manipulated by the creator-user.

The software can be initiated by executing the loginwindow.py python code, any other code would not be able to initiate the execution as they are internally connected
and pass/recieve some data.

The user needs to enter his/her username and password in order to sign in to the software and then choose the database he/she wants to access from the list all of 
his/her databases, he/she may even create a new database if required and then access it and enjoy the features of the software.
